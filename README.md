---

## Notes

- Be sure to document your solution thoroughly, including:
  - How to deploy the environment = I use Jenkins Pipeline by integrating Git or GitHub into the Job Pipeline that I created.
  - Explanation of tools and services used = For tools, I use Hyper-V as a virtual machine on my laptop.
  - Assumptions and challenges encountered during implementation = The assumption is to create an application with the aim of balancing network traffic. The challenge during implementation is the lack of hardware to facilitate implementation.
  - Recommendation of improvement can be implement on this Project = Actually, I really wanted to add some recommendations such as Monitoring Tools with Grafana & Prometheus and others, but because I had other work to do, I didn't have enough time to do it.
- You are encouraged to showcase additional skills or optimizations (e.g., scaling, monitoring, or securing the application) = The answer is the same as the question above.
